# Scaffold
Development Environment

### SDK:
Currently provide Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 support only.
<br>Uncompress sdk libraries' archives to a folder and the directory structure would look like as following:
<div align=left>
<img width="193" height="525" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xurendong/scaffold/master/IMG/sdk_directory_structure.png" alt="recommend directory structure"/>
</div>
Change the value of "SDKDIR_PATH" in other project's main CMakeLists.txt file to your sdk libraries' folder path.
<br>You'd better recompile these sdk libraries under your development environment.
